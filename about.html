    <h1>About the site</h1>
    <p>This site was developed as a side project to develop a PWA and also present the drinks lists for the Peterborough CAMRA Beer Festival 2019 in an orderable, searchable way.</p>
    <p>The site is 100% unofficial and has no affiliation with CAMRA or the beer festival. As such, data on this site could be incorrect or out of date.</p>
    <h2>PWA</h2>
    <p>This site is available for download as a PWA (Progressive Web App). This will enable you to download the site as an "app" that will appear alongside your other apps and should work offline. It's my first PWA so likely isn't perfect!</p>
    <p>How to add the PWA to your phone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On an Android device:</strong> Open the website in Chrome - you should get a prompt to "Add Pbo Beer 2019 Lists to Home screen".</li>
        <li><strong>On an iOS device:</strong> Click the share icon in the browser and select "Add to Home Screen".</li>
    </ul>
